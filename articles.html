                                        means that the person may be less interested in certain activities, such as work or social gatherings. "Often, [dying] people are very focused on their family and on things that are important to them to do before

                                        lives. This fatigue prompts them to sleep more, often for most of the day. There are multiple causes for this fatigue. If the person has cancer, the cancer cells can consume a lot of the person's energy, O'Connor
